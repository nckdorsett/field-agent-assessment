### Field Agent ThymeLeaf Plan
### Goal: To look just like the React project.

1. Implement validations in the model.
    - adjust service for these validations
    - retest validations in service test
    - custom validations (at least try it)
2. Add AgentUiController
    - GetMapping for home page which displays table of
    agents
    - Get/PostMapping to show a form for adding an agent
    - Get/PostMapping for updating an agent
    - Get/PostMapping for deleting an agent
    - Use BindingResult for errors
3. Make all posts use a single template
    - Adding, updating, and deleting will all use 
    the same form but show different buttons and info
    for each option
    - buttons include submit and cancel
4. Add bootswatch template

### stretch
- add HomeController
- functioning navbar (navbar did not function in react)
- make popup form like bug-safari
- make homescreen different than view all agents screen
- add view agent by id screen that displays agencies 
and aliases.
    
#### Things to note
- Need to set database to use test initially,
change when all is done
